# Fury on VMs

This step-by-step tutorial helps you deploy a full Kubernetes Fury Cluster on a set of already existing VMs.

> ☁️ If you prefer trying Fury in a cloud environment, check out the [Fury on EKS][fury-on-eks] tutorial.

The goal of this tutorial is to introduce you to the main concepts of KFD and how to work with its tooling.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes some basic familiarity with Kubernetes.

To follow this tutorial, you need:

- **kubectl** - 1.29.x to interact with the cluster.
- **Ansible** - used by furyctl to execute the roles from KFD installers
- VMs OS: Rocky Linux 8, Debian 12, or Ubuntu 20
- Valid FQDN for all the VMs, with a valid domain: for example, each VM should have a corresponding DNS entry like `worker1.example.tld`, `worker2.example.tld`, `master1.worker.tld`, etc.
- Static IP address for each VM.
- Two VMs for the load balancer Nodes (at least 1vCPU 1GB RAM each)
- An additional IP that will be used by keepalived to expose the two load balancers in HA, and a DNS record pointed to this IP for the control-plane address.
- Three VMs for the master nodes (at least 2vCPU and 4GB RAM each)
- Three VMs for the worker nodes (at least 4vCPU and 8GB RAM each)
- `root` or passwordless sudo user SSH access to the VMs

## Step 0 - Setup and initialize the environment

1. Open a terminal

2. Clone the [fury getting started repository](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-getting-started) containing all the example code used in this tutorial:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sighupio/fury-getting-started/
    cd fury-getting-started/fury-on-vms
    ```

## Step 1 - Install furyctl

Install `furyctl` binary following the instructions in [furyctl's documentation][furyctl-installation].

We recommend to always install the latest version available. Latest versions are compatible with previous versions of the distribution. This guide assumes that furyctl version is at least 0.29.5. You can check with the following command:

```bash
furyctl version
```

## Step 2 - Initialize the PKI

Kubernetes expects you to configure and use TLS to provide data encryption in transit within the control plane, and between the control plane and its clients. To initialize the Public Key Infrastructure needed to create the TLS certificates for the several components of the cluster, first, we need to initialize the Certificate Authorities for Kubernetes and for the etcd database and then create the certificates for each component. Luckily for us, `furyctl` can create for you all of this by running the following command:

```bash
furyctl create pki
```

> 💡 **TIP**
>
> See the command's help for advanced options: `furyctl create pki --help`.

<!-- spacer -->

> ℹ️ **INFO**
>
> Learn more on [Kubernetes security documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/#control-plane-protection).

After the initialization of the PKI, you should have a `pki` folder with the following contents:

```text
pki
├── etcd
│   ├── ca.crt
│   └── ca.key
└── master
    ├── ca.crt
    ├── ca.key
    ├── front-proxy-ca.crt
    ├── front-proxy-ca.key
    ├── sa.key
    └── sa.pub
```

## Step 3 - Decide the strategy for the SSL certificates

We use the HTTPS protocol to expose the KFD ingresses securely. HTTPS relies on certificates that need to be present, there are two approaches to achieve this:

1) Provide a self-signed certificate
2) Use cert-manager to generate the certificates

### Self-signed certificate

If you are using the first approach, you need to have at hand the `tls.key`, `tls.crt`, and `ca.crt` files.
To generate these files using `openssl`, you can run the following commands:

```bash
openssl genrsa -out ca-key.pem 2048
openssl req -x509 -new -days 365 -nodes -key ca-key.pem -out ca.crt -subj "/CN=kube-ca"
openssl genrsa -out tls.key 2048
openssl req -new -key tls.key -out csr.pem -subj "/CN=kube-ca" -config req-dns.cnf
openssl x509 -req -in csr.pem -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca-key.pem -CAcreateserial -out tls.crt -days 365 -extensions v3_req -extfile req-dns.cnf
```

The file `req-dns.cnf` is already present the tutorial directory, with the following content:

```text
[req]
req_extensions = v3_req
distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
[req_distinguished_name]
[ v3_req ]
basicConstraints = CA:FALSE
keyUsage = nonRepudiation, digitalSignature, keyEncipherment
subjectAltName = @alt_names
[alt_names]
DNS.1 = fury.example.tld
DNS.2 = *.fury.example.tld
```

Change it accordingly to your environment

### cert-manager

With cert-manager you can get valid certificates automatically created for you. You can use the `http01` challenge to get certificates from Let's Encrypt if your load-balancer is reachable from the Internet, otherwise, we suggest using the `dns01` solvers that use an authoritative DNS zone to emit certificates.

KFD includes cert-manager in its core packages and it is fully integrated with the distribution. We will use cert-manager with the `dns01` challenge approach in this tutorial.

## Step 4 - Write the `furyctl.yaml` configuration file

The next step is to write the configuration file used by `furyctl`, in the tutorial directory is present a pre-compiled file that you can use as a starting point.

We will explain in this step, what the important fields are for.

### `.spec.kubernetes`

#### PKI and access

```yaml
---
spec:
  kubernetes:
    pkiFolder: ./pki
    ssh:
      username: root
      keyPath: ./ssh-key
```

This first piece of configuration defines where to find the PKI files (created in step 1), and the SSH connection details for the `root` user.
`keyPath` can be a relative or an absolute path.

#### Common DNS zone and networking

```yaml
---
spec:
  kubernetes:
    dnsZone: example.tld
    controlPlaneAddress: control-plane.example.tld:6443
    podCidr: 172.16.128.0/17
    svcCidr: 172.16.0.0/17
```

Next we need to define the DNS zone used by all the nodes and the control-plane address. Also, we need to define the network CIDR for the Pods and network CIDR for the Kubernetes services used in the cluster. These CIDRs must not collide with the IPs of the nodes.

#### Load Balancers configuration

```yaml
spec:
  kubernetes:
    loadBalancers:
      enabled: true
      hosts:
        - name: haproxy1
          ip: 192.168.1.177
        - name: haproxy2
          ip: 192.168.1.178
      keepalived:
        enabled: true
        interface: enp0s8
        ip: 192.168.1.179/32
        virtualRouterId: "201"
        passphrase: "b16cf069"
      stats:
        username: admin
        password: password
      additionalConfig: "{file://./haproxy-additional.cfg}"
```

Next we need to define the load-balancer nodes, each node will have a name and an IP address, additionally, we are also enabling keepalived on an additional floating IP address, in this example `192.168.1.179`. **Important** check which is the main interface that will be used for the keepalived IP, in this example `enp0s8`.

We need also to give the HAproxy statistics (stats) page a username and a password, and we can also add an additional config to the HAproxy running the load balancers. In the example file we are also balancing the ingress battery using the same load balancers as the control plane address.

#### Kubernetes Master and Worker nodes

```yaml
spec:
  kubernetes:
    masters:
      hosts:
        - name: master1
          ip: 192.168.1.181
        - name: master2
          ip: 192.168.1.182
        - name: master3
          ip: 192.168.1.183
    nodes:
      - name: worker
        hosts:
          - name: worker1
            ip: 192.168.1.184
          - name: worker2
            ip: 192.168.1.185
          - name: worker3
            ip: 192.168.1.186
        taints: []
```

Next we need to define the masters node and the worker nodes. The FQDN that will be used for each node will be the concatenation of the name and the `.spec.kubernetes.dnsZone` field.

For example, `master1` will become `master1.example.tld`.

### `.spec.distribution`

#### Networking core module

```yaml
spec:
  distribution:
    modules:
      networking:
        type: calico
```

In this piece of configuration, we are choosing to install calico as CNI in our cluster from the `fury-kubernetes-networking` core module.

#### Ingress core module

```yaml
spec:
  distribution:
    modules:
      ingress:
        baseDomain: fury.example.tld
        nginx:
          type: single
          tls:
            provider: certManager
        certManager:
          clusterIssuer:
            name: letsencrypt-fury
            email: example@sighup.io
            solvers:
              - dns01:
                  route53:
                    region: eu-west-1
                    accessKeyID: AKIAEXAMPLE
                    secretAccessKeySecretRef:
                      name: letsencrypt-production-route53-key
                      key: secret-access-key
```

In this section, on the configuration of the `fury-kubernetes-ingress` core module, we are selecting to install a single battery of nginx ingress controller and configuring cert-manager as the provider to emit SSL certificates for our ingresses.
`baseDomain` is the suffix hostname used on all the ingresses that will be created for the KFD modules, for example, Grafana will become `grafana.<baseDomain>`.

To correctly configure the cert-manager clusterIssuer we need to put a valid configuration for the `dns01` challenge solver. The secret `letsencrypt-production-route53-key` will be created using furyctl's plugins feature in the next steps.

> If instead you want to use a self-signed certificate (or a valid one from a file), you need to configure the ingress module like the following:
>
> ```yaml
>spec:
>  distribution:
>    modules:
>      ingress:
>        baseDomain: fury.example.tld
>        nginx:
>          type: single
>          tls:
>            provider: secret
>            secret:
>              cert: "{file://./tls.crt}"
>              key: "{file://./tls.key}"
>              ca: "{file://./ca.crt}"
>        certManager:
>          clusterIssuer:
>            name: letsencrypt-fury
>            email: example@sighup.io
>            type: http01
> ```

#### Logging core module

```yaml
spec:
  distribution:
    modules:
      logging:
        type: loki
        minio:
          storageSize: "20Gi"
```

This section configures the `fury-kubernetes-logging` module. In this example we are installing Loki as log storage, and configuring the Logging operator with all the Flows and Outputs to send logs to the Loki stack.

The minio configuration is the S3 bucket used by Loki to store logs, the storageSize selected defines the size for each minio disk, in total 6 disks split in 2 per 3 minio replicas.

#### Monitoring core module

```yaml
spec:
  distribution:
    modules:
      monitoring:
        type: prometheus
```

This section configures the `fury-kubernetes-monitoring` module. The complete stack with Prometheus.

#### Policy (OPA) core module and Tracing core module

```yaml
spec:
  distribution:
    modules:
      policy:
        type: none
      tracing:
        type: none
```

For simplicity, we are not installing a policy system (Gatekeeper or Kyverno) and a tracing solution (Tempo) in the cluster.

#### DR core module

```yaml
spec:
  distribution:
    modules:
      dr:
        type: on-premises
        velero: {}
```

We are also configuring Velero for the cluster backups from the `fury-kubernetes-dr` module. Velero will be deployed with a minio instance used to store all the backups.

#### Auth core module

```yaml
spec:
  distribution:
    modules:
      auth:
        provider:
          type: none
```

This section configures the authentication for the ingresses and also the authentication via OIDC on the APIServer, for simplicity we are disabling the authentication on the ingresses and not configuring the OIDC authentication for the APIserver.

### `.spec.plugins`

```yaml
spec:
  plugins:
    kustomize:
      - name: cert-manager-secret
        folder: ./cert-manager-secret/
      - name: storage
        folder: https://github.com/rancher/local-path-provisioner/deploy?ref=v0.0.24
```

This section configures additional plugins to be installed in the cluster. There can be two types of plugin, `helm` and `kustomize`, in this example we are installing two Kustomize projects.

The first one, under the `cert-manager-secret` folder, installs the secret used by cert-manager to interact with the route53 zone for the dns01 challenge. Change the example values in the `./cert-manager-secret` folder with the correct credentials to interact with your route53 zone.

The second one, storage, installs the `local-path-provisioner` that provides a simple dynamic storage for the cluster (not production grade).

## Step 5 - Launch the installation with `furyctl`

Now that everything is configured you can proceed with the installation using the `furyctl` CLI.

Simply execute:

```bash
furyctl apply --outdir $PWD
```

> ⏱ The process will take some minutes to complete, you can follow the progress in detail by running the following command:
>
> ```bash
> tail -f .furyctl/furyctl.<timestamp>-<random-id>.log | jq
> ```
>
> `--outdir` flag is used to define in which directory to create the hidden `.furyctl` folder that contains all the required files to install the cluster.
> If not provided, a `.furyctl` folder will be created in the user's home directory.

The output should be similar to the following:

```bash
INFO Downloading distribution...
INFO Validating configuration file...
INFO Downloading dependencies...
INFO Validating dependencies...
INFO Running preflight checks
INFO Preflight checks completed successfully
INFO Running preupgrade phase...
INFO Preupgrade phase completed successfully
INFO Creating Kubernetes Fury cluster...
INFO Checking that the hosts are reachable...
INFO Running ansible playbook...
INFO Kubernetes cluster created successfully
INFO Installing Kubernetes Fury Distribution...
INFO Checking that the cluster is reachable...
INFO Checking storage classes...
WARN No storage classes found in the cluster. logging module (if enabled), tracing module (if enabled), dr module (if enabled) and prometheus-operated package installation will be skipped. You need to install a StorageClass and re-run furyctl to install the missing components.
INFO Applying manifests...
INFO Kubernetes Fury Distribution installed successfully
INFO Applying plugins...
INFO Plugins installed successfully
INFO Saving furyctl configuration file in the cluster...
INFO Saving distribution configuration file in the cluster...
```

🚀 Success! The first deployment step is complete. Run `furyctl` again to install all the components that needs a working storageClass now, since we installed one using plugins function.

```bash
furyctl create cluster --outdir $PWD --skip-deps-download
```

> To speed up the following executions, you can use `--skip-deps-download`. This works only if the `.furyctl` folder has been already initialized.

```bash
INFO Downloading distribution...
INFO Validating configuration file...
INFO Validating dependencies...
INFO Running preflight checks
INFO Checking that the cluster is reachable...
INFO Preflight checks completed successfully
INFO Running preupgrade phase...
INFO Preupgrade phase completed successfully
INFO Creating Kubernetes Fury cluster...
INFO Checking that the hosts are reachable...
INFO Running ansible playbook...
INFO Kubernetes cluster created successfully

INFO Checking storage classes...
INFO Applying manifests...
INFO Kubernetes Fury Distribution installed successfully
INFO Applying plugins...
INFO Plugins installed successfully
INFO Saving furyctl configuration file in the cluster...
INFO Saving distribution configuration file in the cluster...
```

To interact with the cluster a `kubeconfig` has been created on the folder, make it usable with `kubectl` with:

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=$PWD/kubeconfig
```
